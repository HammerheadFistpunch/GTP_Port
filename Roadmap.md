# GTP_Port Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-08-17

## Product direction

AngrySquirrel.org is intended to remain a fast, low-maintenance personal site with two equally important jobs:

1. present professional portfolio/resume material clearly; and
2. support long-form editorial publishing without locking content into a proprietary CMS.

The durable architecture is Astro + Git-backed Markdown/MDX + TinaCMS, deployed on Cloudflare. Immich remains the private source media library while selected website assets are copied to R2 for public delivery.

## Current state

The core platform is operational:

- Astro 6 static site on Cloudflare Pages
- TinaCloud owner editing at `/admin/`
- deliberate **Publish Site** workflow rather than automatic production builds on every save
- unified Journal content model with Draft/Published status
- Tina-managed Journal Sections and Topics
- durable `/archive/[slug]/` Journal detail URLs and `/tags/[slug]/` Topic archives
- structured Homepage, Journal landing page, Resume, About, and Contact content
- Custom Pages with constrained reusable blocks
- Markdown-first authoring for Journal and page body content
- Markdown/MDX import including body-only Google Docs exports
- private Immich browsing/search/album access from Tina
- permanent R2 publication for selected website images
- responsive Immich picker and common structured-image integration
- RSS, sitemap, robots, canonical, Open Graph, and Twitter metadata

## Active priorities

### 1. Gallery architecture and privacy

**Status: next major feature area.**

The current Immich Gallery block still depends on live gallery/share behavior. Replace or harden it so public gallery pages do not expose long-lived Immich share tokens or reveal the home origin.

Evaluate:

- R2-mirrored gallery manifests/assets
- a restricted Cloudflare Worker/Pages Function gallery facade
- a deliberate hybrid where gallery metadata is live but public images remain edge-hosted

Acceptance goals:

- no private Immich API credentials in browser content
- no residential/home origin disclosure
- graceful behavior if Immich is offline
- gallery authoring remains practical in Tina
- existing gallery content has a migration path

### 2. Immich picker polish

**Status: follow-up refinement.**

Known UX work:

- use infinite scrolling instead of manual **Load more** in image and gallery pickers
- continue verifying album browsing against large libraries
- preserve full-screen/touch-friendly mobile behavior
- keep Markdown and preview panes usable at narrow and desktop widths

### 3. Authoring/editor hardening

Continue simplifying Tina around the owner's workflow rather than exposing implementation details.

Priorities:

- confirm all Draft → Published → Draft transitions correctly remove/add public routes after a deliberate publish
- ensure Topics/Journal Sections can be created safely without breaking TinaCloud schema/indexing or production builds
- add clearer recovery behavior for invalid content references
- retain body portability and sanitized preview behavior

### 4. Documentation as maintained product surface

The repository now has five durable documentation files only:

- `README.md`
- `HELP.md`
- `Roadmap.md`
- `SITE_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md`
- `SITE_MAP.md`

Update these when behavior changes. Do not recreate sprint diaries, temporary audit documents, or duplicate feature guides unless there is a specific short-lived engineering need; use issues/commits for implementation history.

## Planned / optional improvements

These are useful candidates but not current requirements:

- **Pagefind search** when Journal volume makes search valuable
- **Giscus comments** if public discussion is desired
- **generated Resume PDF** sourced from the existing structured Resume content, never a second manually maintained resume dataset
- **more advanced related-content ranking** if current shared-Topic/Section ranking becomes insufficient
- **additional Custom Page blocks** only when a real page cannot be built cleanly with the constrained set
- **configuration-as-code for Cloudflare** only after the complete existing Pages/Tunnel/Access/R2 configuration is inventoried and can be represented without losing dashboard-managed settings

## Architecture guardrails

- Git-backed content remains portable and authoritative.
- Tina should make owner tasks easier without becoming a second source of truth.
- Keep public output static wherever practical.
- Use structured fields where structure has a clear editorial or rendering benefit; keep prose as Markdown.
- Treat established public slugs/paths as durable. Add redirects before moving them.
- Keep Immich credentials, Cloudflare service tokens, deploy hooks, and other secrets server-side only.
- Public website media should not require the home Immich server to remain online after publication.
- Never hand-edit generated Tina lock data.
- Any schema change must update Tina, Astro validation, stored content, renderers/queries, lock/index state, and tests together.
- Preserve the current visual system unless intentionally redesigning it.

## Definition of done for future work

A feature is complete when applicable items are true:

- implementation is on the latest `gpt-handoff` branch
- stored content remains valid and portable
- Tina editor behavior is verified
- Astro build succeeds
- authoring tests/type checks pass where relevant
- Cloudflare bindings/secrets/access policies are verified when touched
- public routes and responsive rendering are reviewed
- redirects are added for changed public URLs
- security-sensitive endpoints are tested for both allowed and denied access when authentication changes
- the relevant durable documentation above is updated
