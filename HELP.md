# AngrySquirrel.org Help Guide

This is the owner-facing reference for editing, importing, publishing, media, appearance, and common site changes.

## 1. TinaCMS navigation

Open `https://angrysquirrel.org/admin/`.

Current owner navigation:

- **Settings**
  - Site Settings
  - Appearance
  - Topics
  - Publish Site
- **Pages**
  - Main Homepage
  - Journal Homepage
  - About
  - Contact
  - Resume
  - Custom Pages
- **Content**
  - Journal
  - Journal Sections
  - Import
- **Media**
  - Media Manager

## 2. Editing and publishing basics

Tina saves to GitHub first. Saving content is intentionally separate from publishing the production site.

Normal workflow:

1. Edit content in Tina.
2. Save as often as needed.
3. Keep unfinished Journal entries or Custom Pages in **Draft**.
4. When the editing session is ready, open **Settings → Publish Site**.
5. If Saved and Live differ, publish once.
6. Review the deployed site after the saved commit is reported live.

If Saved and Live match, there is nothing new to publish.

## 3. Journal entries

Every item under **Content → Journal** uses the same Journal model.

Main fields:

- Title
- Markdown body
- Journal Section
- Status: Draft or Published
- Topics
- Description
- Publication Date
- Cover Image
- optional Immich Gallery

### Recommended authoring order

1. Write the title.
2. Write or paste the body.
3. Choose the Journal Section.
4. Set Draft/Published status.
5. Choose Topics.
6. Add description/date/cover/gallery as needed.
7. Save.
8. Publish the site only when the full editing session is ready.

Journal detail URLs are `/archive/[slug]/`.

### Draft behavior

Draft content remains stored in Tina/GitHub but should not receive a public article route after the next successful production build.

If a previously published article is changed back to Draft, save it and deliberately publish the site so the public build is regenerated without that route.

## 4. Journal Sections vs Topics

Use **Journal Section** for where the story belongs. Use **Topics** for what the story is about.

### Journal Sections

Managed at **Content → Journal Sections**.

A section has:

- name
- permanent slug
- description
- Active/Retired state
- previous slugs/aliases

Guidance:

- Rename the visible name freely.
- Treat the slug as durable.
- Retire old sections rather than removing historical meaning.
- Use previous slugs when intentionally migrating a section URL.

### Topics

Managed at **Settings → Topics**.

A Topic has:

- Topic Name
- description
- Active/Retired state
- optional Replacement Topic
- permanent slug
- previous slugs

Guidance:

- Add a Topic for a reusable subject, not every one-off phrase.
- Rename the visible Topic Name freely.
- Keep the permanent slug stable unless intentionally changing the public URL.
- Retire rather than delete when old stories still use a Topic.
- Use Replacement Topic only when two Topics are deliberately consolidated.

The underlying collection is still named `tags` and public Topic pages remain `/tags/[slug]/` for compatibility.

## 5. Markdown editor

Journal bodies and supported page body fields use a Markdown-first editor.

The toolbar supports:

- bold
- italic
- strikethrough
- inline code
- bulleted lists
- numbered lists
- links
- Media Manager images
- Immich/R2 images
- external HTTPS images
- YouTube

Desktop provides Write/Split/Preview. Mobile uses Write/Preview to avoid an unusable split view.

Use standard Markdown whenever possible.

### YouTube

The supported inline MDX form is:

```mdx
<YouTube url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" title="Descriptive title" caption="Optional caption" />
```

Do not add arbitrary custom components or executable MDX to normal content.

## 6. Images and media

There are three normal image sources.

### A. Choose from Immich — preferred for photo-library images

Use **Choose from Immich** on structured image fields or **Immich image** in the Markdown toolbar.

Workflow:

1. Open the picker.
2. Search or browse albums.
3. Select an image.
4. The protected backend asks Immich for website-size variants.
5. The selected variants are copied/reused in Cloudflare R2.
6. Tina stores only the permanent public `media.angrysquirrel.org` URL.

This means a normal page image continues to work even if the home Immich server is temporarily offline.

### B. Media Manager

Use **Media Manager** for repository-managed uploads when appropriate. These normally use `/uploads/...` paths.

### C. External image URL

Safe public HTTPS image URLs are supported where exposed. Avoid credential-bearing URLs, temporary signed URLs, or private hosts.

### Image quality and dimensions for Immich → R2

The backend currently copies Immich-generated `thumbnail` and larger preview variants rather than processing originals itself. Therefore, the dimensions/quality of newly published website images are controlled primarily by **Immich's image/thumbnail settings**.

If the image-generation recipe changes materially, update `MEDIA_VARIANT_VERSION` in Cloudflare so newly selected images receive new immutable R2 URLs rather than colliding with older cached variants.

Existing R2 images are intentionally not overwritten.

## 7. Immich galleries

Gallery content currently uses the site's gallery integration rather than the single-image R2 publication path. Gallery architecture/privacy is the next major roadmap area.

Until that work is completed:

- do not expose private Immich API keys anywhere in content
- do not paste private origin URLs into public pages
- use the existing supported gallery fields/blocks only
- treat public share URLs/tokens as sensitive publication data

See `Roadmap.md` for the planned gallery hardening work.

## 8. Import guide

Use **Content → Import** to turn Markdown/MDX into a normal Journal draft.

### Supported input

- `.md`
- supported `.mdx`
- pasted Markdown/MDX source
- body-only Google Docs Markdown exports
- Markdown with YAML frontmatter

Frontmatter is optional. The importer generates canonical Tina frontmatter after review.

### Recommended Google Docs workflow

1. Export or convert the Google Doc to Markdown.
2. Do **not** manually add YAML just to satisfy the importer.
3. Open **Content → Import**.
4. Upload the `.md` file or paste the Markdown source.
5. Choose **Review Import**.
6. Confirm the full document body appears in the body field.
7. Review/edit the derived filename and title.
8. Add description, Journal Section, Topics, date, and cover as needed.
9. Choose **Create imported draft**.
10. Review the created entry in the normal Journal editor.
11. Publish it only when ready.

The importer always creates a Draft and should never overwrite an existing filename.

### Frontmatter mapping

When frontmatter exists, common keys map as follows:

| Site field | Accepted source keys |
| --- | --- |
| Title | `title` |
| Description | `description`, `summary`, `excerpt` |
| Publication date | `date`, `publishedDate`, `published_at` |
| Journal Section | `journalSection`, `section` |
| Topics | YAML list, comma-separated values, existing references |
| Cover image | `coverImage`, `cover`, `image`, `featured_image` |

Older deprecated metadata may be recognized for review but is not part of the current Journal model.

### Topic matching during import

The review screen should show active Topics as selectable choices. It can also resolve existing Topic labels/slugs/references.

If a Topic does not exist, create it under **Settings → Topics** before completing the imported draft.

### Import safety rules

Ordinary Markdown is supported, including headings, paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, tables, code fences, links, and images.

The importer rejects unsafe or unsupported content such as:

- malformed frontmatter
- empty bodies
- unsafe image/link destinations
- credential-bearing URLs
- executable MDX expressions
- `import` / `export` statements
- unsupported custom MDX components
- malformed YouTube components

The body should remain portable Markdown/MDX after import.

## 9. Fixed pages

Fixed editable page content lives in Tina under **Pages**.

- Main Homepage
- Journal Homepage
- About
- Contact
- Resume

### Homepage

The Homepage is intentionally structured rather than a completely free-form page builder. Use Tina to edit its section content, visibility, order, Journal feature/recent count, and portfolio destinations.

### Resume

The Resume is one structured source. Update the Resume through Tina rather than maintaining a separate second dataset. Any future generated PDF should consume this same source.

## 10. Custom Pages

Custom Pages support standalone and nested content using an explicit **URL Path**.

Supported blocks include:

- Rich Text
- Image
- YouTube Video
- Immich Gallery
- Child Page Tiles
- Call to Action

Important routing rule: changing a page title does not change its URL; changing its `path` does. Established public paths should receive a redirect before they are changed.

Physical folders under `src/content/flexible-pages/` are for editorial organization. The explicit `path` field controls the public route.

## 11. Navigation, header, footer, and site identity

Most owner-editable header/footer navigation lives in:

`src/content/settings/site.md`

Use **Settings → Site Settings** in Tina for normal changes such as:

- site name / logo text
- default description
- primary navigation
- nested navigation
- footer links/text
- copyright name

If a change is not exposed there, the presentation logic is in Astro components/layouts rather than content.

## 12. Appearance: fonts, sizes, colors, spacing, and widths

For normal site-wide visual changes, use **Settings → Appearance** in Tina. You no longer need to edit CSS for the common design controls listed below.

The stored Appearance data lives at:

`src/data/appearance.json`

### Typography controls

- **UI Font** — navigation, buttons, labels, and interface text
- **Editorial Font** — headings and editorial display type
- **Body Font Size** — base site text size in pixels
- **Article Font Size** — long-form Journal paragraph size in pixels
- **Heading Scale** — global multiplier for heading sizes; `1.0` preserves the original scale
- **Line Height** — global text line-height multiplier

Supported UI fonts are Lato, Inter, Source Sans 3, and the system sans-serif stack. Supported editorial fonts are Newsreader, Merriweather, Source Serif 4, and Georgia.

### Layout controls

- **Maximum Site Width** — shared `.container` width
- **Reading Column Width** — long-form `.reading-width` and article width

A few component-specific layouts may intentionally impose their own narrower constraints; Appearance controls the shared design system rather than overriding every local layout decision.

### Color controls

- Page Background
- Surface Background
- Elevated Surface
- Primary Text
- Secondary Text
- Accent Color

Use CSS color values; hex colors such as `#4F91C7` are recommended.

### Shape and spacing controls

- Small / Medium Corner Radius
- Small / Medium / Large / Extra Large Spacing

These feed the shared CSS variables used by cards, sections, utilities, and other components.

### Safe adjustment ranges

The editor descriptions provide recommended ranges. For small experiments, change one or two values at a time, save, deliberately publish, and review desktop and mobile. The committed default values reproduce the pre-Appearance design.

### What still requires code

Appearance intentionally does **not** expose arbitrary CSS, per-page margins, custom class names, animation rules, or every component-specific measurement. Those remain code-controlled to prevent accidental layout breakage.

The implementation lives in:

- `src/data/appearance.json` — Tina-edited values
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` — converts values into global CSS custom properties
- `src/styles/variables.css` — fallback/default design tokens
- `src/styles/typography.css` — typography rules and supported web-font loading
- `src/styles/utilities.css` — shared container/spacing helpers
- `tina/config.ts` — Appearance editor fields

## 13. Where code changes live

| What you want to change | Main location |
| --- | --- |
| Site content | `src/content/` via Tina |
| Nav/footer/site settings | `src/content/settings/site.md` |
| Normal global visual settings | **Settings → Appearance** / `src/data/appearance.json` |
| CSS token fallbacks | `src/styles/variables.css` |
| Typography rules/font loading | `src/styles/typography.css` |
| Global CSS behavior | `src/styles/global.css` |
| Reusable UI | `src/components/` |
| Shared page/entry layouts | `src/layouts/` |
| Public routes | `src/pages/` |
| Tina collections/fields | `tina/config.ts` |
| Custom Tina controls/editor | `tina/components/` |
| Astro content validation | `src/content.config.ts` |
| Publishing API | `functions/admin/api/publish.js` |
| Media APIs | `functions/admin/api/media/` |
| Immich/R2 server logic | `src/server/media-backend.js` |

For a full technical repository and route map, see `SITE_MAP.md`. For safe maintenance procedures, see `SITE_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md`.

## 14. Common recovery situations

### A save succeeded but the live site did not change

This is normally expected. Open **Settings → Publish Site** and compare Saved vs Live. Production only changes after a deliberate publish.

### A build failed

The previous working Cloudflare deployment should remain live. Read the first useful build error, fix the content/source issue on `gpt-handoff`, save/push the correction, then publish again.

### Tina reports a schema mismatch

Do not assume reindexing alone will fix it. Verify that `tina/config.ts`, stored content/data, renderers, and `tina/tina-lock.json` all describe the same model. If an Astro content collection changed, also verify `src/content.config.ts`. Regenerate the lock through Tina tooling, then reindex TinaCloud.

### An Appearance change looks wrong

Restore the affected value in **Settings → Appearance** and save again. Because Appearance is Git-backed, previous values are also recoverable from Git history. If the editor itself is unavailable after an Appearance schema change, restore `src/data/appearance.json` and verify the Tina schema/lock before reindexing.

### An old URL needs to move

Add a redirect first, then change the public route/path. Do not silently break established URLs.

### An R2 image is no longer needed

Do not delete it casually. Search the repository first because old revisions are intentionally immutable and existing Markdown may still reference them.
